# QC GWC Workshop: Intro to NodeJS and JavaScript
## Friday March 18th @ 12:00PM - 1:15PM EST
---

> ### Read the Installation Guide in **TestRun_Doc.md** and the **Workshop Notes.md** file before running the `test_run.js` file!

JavaScript is one of the main programming languages for Full Stack web development. Learn JavaScript syntax, facts about the language and NodeJS as an interpreter, function & object creation, and asynchronous calls. This is a beginner-friendly workshop, no previous programming knowledge is needed!

**Prerequisites:**
* The latest version of NodeJS must be installed.
* Visual Studio Code must be installed. 
* Download the project files before the workshop.
* Run the `test_run.js` file in Visual Studio Code to ensure your files can be tested in the console.

We’ll build a step-by-step console application together to load up a JSON file, and use the results to randomly select a card from a Tarot deck with a description. We'll also be doing some other misc. exercises to get you comfortable with JavaScript. In the console, we’ll also be creating a load bar for the data being read. We’ll be creating our own Tarot Class to manipulate the results, with the main file to run the program using NodeJS. A small task to help you learn as much as possible. I look forward to seeing you there!
