## **Workshop Notes**
* This is a good time to remind you that this workshop is intended for beginners to both programming and JavaScript. For intermediate+ programmers, some of the material may be basic at the beginning but it's still necessary to learn. Try the challenge problems at the end of this file if you feel like you can tackle them!

* Unfortunately, I don't touch anything regarding the [`zlib`](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html) module in this workshop. This is for compressing and decompressing files using NodeJS, particularly useful if you want to hide sensitive data from others.

* I also don't go over the [`http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or [`https`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) modules, in general running servers. If you want to try running servers using the these modules, I recommend also using [`express`](https://expressjs.com/) to help expedite your work.

* If you happen to start working with those excluded modules, feel free to reach out if you need help. I look forward to seeing you during the workshop!
